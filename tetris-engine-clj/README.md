## Usage

To run the program on cli:
`$ lein run <input-file-name>`

For example, you can enter:
`$ lein run input.txt`

<input-file-name> is optional.
In case you don't provide, the program will try to read
`input.txt` file saved in the project folder by default.
So, you can just run it by
`$ lein run`

To run unit tests on cli:
`$ lein test`
