Coding test assignment for the senior software engineer role at DRW.
Written by Darren Kim.

## Usage

To run the program on cli:
`$ lein run <optional-input-file-name> <optional-output-file-name>`

For example, you can enter with options:
`$ lein run input.txt output.txt`

In case you don't provide optional arguments,
the program will try to read `input.txt` file saved in the project folder
and generate `output.txt` file by default.

So, you can simply run it by
`$ lein run`

To run unit tests on cli:
`$ lein test`

## Expectation

With the data in `input.txt` file in the given problem,
the program will print result below and save it in the output file.
