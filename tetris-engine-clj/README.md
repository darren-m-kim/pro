# tetris-engine-clj

Coding test assignment for the senior software engineer role at DRW.
Written by Darren Kim.

## Usage

To run the program on cli:
`$ lein run <input-file-name>`

For example, you can enter:
`$ lein run input.txt`

<input-file-name> is optional.
In case you don't provide, the program will try to read
`input.txt` file saved in the project folder by default.
So, you can just run it by
`$ lein run`

To run unit tests on cli:
`$ lein test`

## Expectation

With the data in the given `input.txt` file, the program
will render below result in the console:

~/tetris-engine-clj $ lein run
